Model:

cfdocker.sh does:
	Build - creates new images from Dockerfiles
	Run - creates new container instance from images built with the build command
	Stop - Stops a running container
	Start - Starts a container that has been stopped
	Delete - deletes a running, stopped, or started container

Build:
	Knows about the specific container configuration files
	Generate container specific config files (nats.config, cloud_controller_ng.conf, etc) and load it into the container build directory
	Build the container including the specific config files and git-submodule directories


Add: Ruby config creator
	makecfg.rb <container>
	loads .yaml config file
	loads relevant .erb templates
	populates templates with relevant data from config file

	
Container construction order (ie, working on....)

DONE  - nats (needs config generator)
DONE  - test (including rudimentary test framework)
postgres (with persistent volumes)
cloud controller (may include health manager if required for mvp)
dea_ng
gorouter (may include nginx, experimentation required to determine if this would be best on its own container or not)
uaa (if required for mvp)
login (if required for mvp)
redis gateway
redis node
