	Build - creates new images from Dockerfiles
	Run - creates new container instance from images built with the build command
	Stop - Stops a running container
	Start - Starts a container that has been stopped
	Delete - deletes a running, stopped, or started container

Build:
	Knows about the specific container configuration files
	Generate container specific config files (nats.config, cloud_controller_ng.conf, etc) and load it into the container build directory
	Build the container including the specific config files and git-submodule directories


Add: Ruby config creator
	makecfg.rb <container>
